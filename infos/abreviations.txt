Inputs = communication 3-tuples (sender, receiver, time)
Outputs = (oriented) behavioral trust graph T
Dataset = twitter 10 weeks public communications (2M users, 1910K senders, 230K tweets/day)

w_ij = edge weight between node i and j in T
A, B = a pair of users
M = sorted list of times when message exchanged
C = list of conversations (groups of messages)

T_c = conversational trust graph
T_c(A,B) = conversational trust between A and B (summed conversation length times balance)
H(C_i) = mesure of the balance in conversation C_i (entropy function)
p(C_i) = fraction of message in the conversation sent by A

delta = time interval for propagation to a third person
m_AB = number of message A sent to B
prop_B = number of propagations by B
prop_AB = number of messages A sent to B that were propagated
T_p = directed propagation trust graph
T_p(B,A) = propagation trust B is giving to A (measured by i or ii)

T_r = directed propagation trust graph based on retweets

PS : "_" means indice
